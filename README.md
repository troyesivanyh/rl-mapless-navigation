## Abstract
This work attempts to construct a pseudo laser findings system based on direct depth matrix prediction from a single camera image while still retaining stable performances. The depth prediction phase is inherited from [monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2) pre-trained on the KITTI dataset.   
The pdf version of this work can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t2oz0r66fp4ok81/nics20.zip?dl=0&file_subpath=%2Fpapers%2Fp54-tran.pdf).

## Installation
This repo also contains the trained models of the baseline and ours. It is also daunting to reproduce the result, the reason could be briefly explained by this [article](https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html). See the [installation][./INSTALL.md] for more information.
